# raspi radio gui
im not really sure what to call this really, so ill just leave it at 'raspi radio gui'
the purpose of this is to provide a GUI for the library PiFMRds (https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds) which powers this project (thank you so much!!) and make ham radio easily accessible for amateurs.
js gonnna commit with this readme so i can get the repository set up.
